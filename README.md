Through data-driven analysis and interactive dashboards, this project aims to answer critical business questions and provide healthcare stakeholders with the information they need to make informed decisions.

# Project Overview
The Healthcare Data Analysis Project explores key performance indicators (KPIs) like patient days, discharges, revenue trends, and regional hospital performance. The analysis identifies patterns, highlights inefficiencies, and suggests opportunities for improvement in healthcare management.

# Key Objectives:
Analyze patient flow, hospital utilization, and care outcomes.
Evaluate financial performance across hospitals and identify revenue trends.
Address operational challenges using a structured data pipeline.
Visualize insights using interactive dashboards to support decision-making.

# Tools and Their Roles
## Excel

Initial data cleaning, formatting, and exploration.
Basic calculations and chart creation for early trend analysis.
## SQL

Creation of a structured relational database.
Querying and aggregations to generate key metrics and KPIs.
## Power BI

Development of interactive dashboards for dynamic data exploration.
Focused on KPI visualizations, such as revenue trends and patient flow.
## Tableau

Advanced visualizations to uncover complex relationships in data.
Highlighted trends and regional performance for a deeper understanding.
# Key Features and Insights
## Visualized KPIs
Patient Days: Monitors hospital workload and identifies inefficiencies.
Total Discharge: Analyzes patient flow by payer type (e.g., Medicare, Medi-Cal).
Net Patient Revenue: Tracks revenue from patient care services to assess profitability.
Revenue Trends: Identifies growth and decline periods for forecasting and strategy development.
State-wise Revenue: Examines hospital performance by state to optimize resource allocation.
# Business Questions Answered
This project helps address the following key business questions:

## Operational Efficiency:

1 Are patient stays too long in certain facilities?


2 Which hospitals face higher patient turnover, and why?


3 How can discharge processes be optimized to improve bed availability?


## Financial Performance:

1 Which revenue streams (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, diagnostics) generate the most profit?


2 How does revenue vary across regions and hospital types (teaching, rural)?


3 What are the seasonal trends in revenue, and how can we prepare for fluctuations?

## Regional Insights:

1 Which states or regions perform better financially?

2 Are there underserved areas where resources need to be allocated?


3 How does population density affect hospital utilization and revenue?

## Resource Management:

1 What is the patient-to-doctor ratio across different hospitals?


2 Are there capacity issues in specific facilities or departments?


3 How can resources like staff and equipment be better distributed?
